        <h3>Project-1</h3>
        <h4>A Bayesian Network and Decision Tree based Composite Weighted Approach for Outlier Detection:</h4>
        <p>In this project, an effective work model is presented to perform the outlier detection and disease classification. In this work a hybrid model is presented
            to identify the outlier over the dataset. This presented model has used the statical information derivation trained by probabilistic model. The statistical
            analysis is applied on individual attribute using decision tree approach whereas the final classification is applied using beysian network approach. The work 
            is implemented in weka integrated java environment. The results shows that the presented model has performed the effective identification of outlier over the dataset.
        </p>
        <h3>Project-2</h3>
        <h4>Cryptography and Steganography Techniques:</h4>
        <p>In this project, I have proposed a new image Steganography technique by combining it with cryptography to provide great level of security.
             I implemented this new algorithm using MATLAB as a stimulator, this is based on LSB.I have used MatLab(2008) as a tool for implementing rail fence cipher and LSB 
             approach for the work.In this secret message is inserted into the cover image by using the LSB based technique, then stego image is obtained and then we will analyze
             the result. The result shows increased security, increased Peak Signal to Noice Ratio (PSNR) and low Mean Square Error (MSE) and the quality of stego-image is also good.
